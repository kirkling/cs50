 /**
  * PART 3 
  * Filename: guessfive.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module1/studios/guessfive
  *
  * Most likely, you've been using a while loop so far. Let's now refactor, and use a for loop instead, just for kicks.  
  * Write another program in a file called guessfive.c, which behaves exactly like guess5, but is implemented with a for loop. 
  * (But if you did use a for loop in guess5, then use a while loop here.)
