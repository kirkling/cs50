/**
  * Part 2
  * Filename: guess5.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module1/studios/guess5
  * 
  * Write another program called guess5, which gives the user only 5 chances to get the answer:
  * This should only involve some minor tweaking, so you can make a copy of your guess.c file using the cp command:
  *        $ cp guess.c guess5.c
  * Open up guess5.c and make changes there.
  *
  * Example:
  *     $ ./guess5
  *     I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. Can you guess what it is?
  *     Guess #1: 8
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #2: 5
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #3: 1
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #4: 7
  *     Wrong!
  *     Guess #5: 6
  *     Wrong!
  *     Sorry, you ran out of guesses.
